# Woofstagram Sign-up Form
In this project, I'am going to build something that almost every app needs- a signup form! The appâ€™s name is Woofstagram, and is basically Instagram for your dogs. This signup form will allow users to provide information about their dogs, and can then save that information away to do things with later. Collecting and storing data is integral to almost all applications, so this is an important and foundational concept when learning to write apps.

Your form should allow people to provide their email for a username, a password, and then metadata about their pet including:

- name
- date of birth
- breed
- favorite toy
